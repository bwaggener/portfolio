For this portfolio I will be documenting my experiences with R as a red-green colorblind individual. 

First, there are certain themes that make using R studio easier. Monokai is the best that I have tried so far. The contrast between the background and the blue text is better and it conveys the color information better than the default theme.

To change theme go to tools-> Global Options-> Appearance-> Editor Theme (pick one from the scroll down options)




```{r, child='p10/demo.Rmd'}
```
